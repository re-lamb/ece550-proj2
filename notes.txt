// single step
si - one inst
x/i $rip - disass inst @ pc

// follow child process
set follow-fork-mode child 
set detach-on-fork off
br executeit 

br 217 	// barrier
br 198	// before child exits
br 224	// waitpid

// debug a child

br 224
run -tn -in -sn
<<should break in parent after the barrier is released, BEFORE waitpid>>

info inferiors
inferior n
<<switch to a child, which should be waiting in fork()!!>>

finish 			(may need several tries to finish the fork() call
				 and return to our code)
s, si, etc 		(to step, dump mem and so on)

-or-

br executeit	(sets this breakpoint in all children)
c

-or-

c will run to the brkpt @ 198 - generate and execute our code but stop before exit()
so we can interrogate the child

<<be sure to 'c' each child to completion / exit then switch back to the parent>>

c to allow the parent to complete normally
